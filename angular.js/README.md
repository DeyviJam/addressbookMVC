# addressBook in Angular.js

This is a very simple application to get acquainted with Angular.js. 
I've covered  creating page navigation bar using `ng-class` directive, form validation, looping through data to list down the contacts and broadcast data from one controller to another.

## Quick start

* [https://github.com/codef0rmer/addressbookMVC/blob/master/readme.md](https://github.com/codef0rmer/addressbookMVC/blob/master/readme.md)

## Running the app

You can pick one of these options:

* serve this repository with your webserver
* install node.js and run `scripts/web-server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html` to see the app running in
your browser.
